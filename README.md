_If you can't decant, distil it._


### Notes

- Currently the framework works only on Android.
- SMS notifications are supported for filtering.
- Some example scripts are provided in the ```plugins``` folder.
- You must manually create a folder called ```decant``` in the *External
storage* directory of your android phone and then copy over the ```plugins```
folder from here into that directory, before playing with the application.
- The SMS messages that are used to demonstrate the capabilities can be
generated from within the application.
