Notes from Santhosh (fragger_fox)

* Scripting, Why?
  - Brings the application alive
  - People can change it, if they do not like it
  - Examples: emacs, firefox, shell, excel

* Client Side Scripting
  - Even the smallest of change requires you have entire to be installed
  - Why not break this paradigm?

* JVM Languages
  - Rhino Javascript can do interoperatibility with Java Objects too
  - This means it can interact with Android components too
  - Garbage Collection / Threads etc are well managed via JVM
  - Rhino can do what Java can do
